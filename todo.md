- ~~Come up with proj name~~
    - ~~rename with the new name~~
- ~~Add project to github~~
- ~~Change test exceptions to assertions~~
- ~~Raise Custom Exceptions~~
    - *Opted to not use exceptions*
    - ~~Learn about this more~~
    - Create custom exceptions
    - update project with custom exceptions
- Raise Custom User Error Class
    - ~~Setup custom user error super class~~
    - This is to be done throughout the project
- ~~Check valid clf package~~
    - ~~check valid model~~
    - ~~check valid hyperparm~~
    - ~~check valid metrics~~
- ~~Select opitmizing metric~~
    - ~~Two choices~~
        - ~~First metric in list is the optimizing metric~~
            - ~~Im choosing this one~~
        - ~~Make a new entry in package (tuple of 4 instead of 3)~~
- ~~Add associated hyperparams~~
- ~~Handle Metrics~~
- ~~Support lists of hyperparams~~
- ~~Hyperpam permutation functions does not support mixes of lists and non lists~~
- Progress Bar
- ~~Handle empty hyperparam values~~
- ~~Handle metrics that cant be used as optimizing metrics~~
    - ~~classification report is one of these~~
- Plotting
    - ~~Linear Regression~~
        ~~Predicted versus True v True versus True~~
    - Classification
        - ~~ROC Curve~~
        - Confusion Matrix
        - How to deal with binary v multinomial?
            - Right now treating everything as multinomial but its possible to do this idk if i want to
        - ~~Test cases now flooded with errors from sklearn but they are useful, adjust test case value so the errors dont appear anymore~~
            - ~~Decided to make plotting opted into so old test cases stop yelling~~
    - ~~Decide if plots should have their own data structure~~
        - ~~Plots should have their own data structure~~

- Error/Warning Handler

- Check Correct Types
- print error only if user wants them, default setting is to print

- Weird bug sometimes hyperparam are missing a parameter? Illegal value maybe?
- Add more models
- Convert built in warnings to warning handled by the warning class
