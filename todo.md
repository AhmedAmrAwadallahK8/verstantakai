    - ~~Learn about this more~~
    - Create custom exceptions
    - update project with custom exceptions
- Raise Custom User Error Class
    - ~~Setup custom user error super class~~
    - This is to be done throughout the project
- ~~Check valid clf package~~
    - ~~check valid model~~
    - ~~check valid hyperparm~~
    - ~~check valid metrics~~
- ~~Select opitmizing metric~~
    - ~~Two choices~~
        - ~~First metric in list is the optimizing metric~~
            - ~~Im choosing this one~~
        - ~~Make a new entry in package (tuple of 4 instead of 3)~~
- ~~Add associated hyperparams~~
- ~~Handle Metrics~~
- ~~Support lists of hyperparams~~
- ~~Hyperpam permutation functions does not support mixes of lists and non lists~~
- Progress Bar
- ~~Handle empty hyperparam values~~
- Handle metrics that cant be used as optimizing metrics
    - classification report is one of these
- Plotting
    - Linear Regression
        Predicted versus True v True v True
    - Conf Matrix Heat Map?
- Check Correct Types

- Weird bug sometimes hyperparam are missing a parameter? Illegal value maybe?
- Add more models
- Convert built in warnings to warning handled by the warning class
